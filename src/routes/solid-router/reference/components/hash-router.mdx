title: HashRouter
---

The `HashRouter` is a top level component that manages the routing of your application.
It's a client side router, utilizing hash-values in the URL, allow your single page application to simulate a multi-page application.

The advantage of hash-routing is that the whole application can run from a single HTML file, which can be hosted on a static file server.

A disadvantage of this approach, compared to the browser-history like the [`Router`](/solid-router/reference/components/router), is that hash-routing isn't SEO friendly.
This is because most search engines don't index the hash part of the URL, so they only see the index page of your application.

The `root` property is used for components that wrap a matched route and require access to the router context, relevant with navigation components that use [`<A>`](/solid-router/reference/components/a) links.

```tsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { HashRouterRouter, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

const App = (props) => (
	<>
		<h1>Root header</h1>
		{props.children}
	</>
);

render(
	() => <HashRouterRouter root={App}>{/*... routes */}</HashRouterRouter>,
	document.getElementById("app")
);
```
