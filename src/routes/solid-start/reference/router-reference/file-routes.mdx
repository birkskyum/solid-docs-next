title: FileRoutes
---

`FileRoutes` is a component that creates a [`Route`](/solid-router/reference/components/route) for each file in the `/src/routes` directory, and these routes can be used inside of a [`Router`](/solid-router/reference/components/router) like in this example of an [`app.tsx`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/app):

```tsx twoslash {7-9} filename="app.tsx"
import { Suspense } from "solid-js";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";
import { FileRoutes } from "@solidjs/start/router";

export default function App() {
	return (
		<Router root={(props) => <Suspense>{props.children}</Suspense>}>
			<FileRoutes />
		</Router>
	);
}
```
See the [SolidStart routing guide](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing) for more details.

<Callout type="caution">
Be careful before you decide to remove the `FileRoutes` component from your `app.tsx` file. If you do, you will need to manually add all of your routes to the `<Routes>` component.

You will still lose out on some optimizations that are enabled by file-system routing like preloaded script tags. While we will caution you however, always be free to explore what you can do.
