Wrapping components in `clientOnly` will make them render only in the client. This can for example be for components that interact directly with the DOM, such as jQuery, as they can't render on the server. It works similar to [`lazy`](/reference/component-apis/lazy) except it only renders after hydration and never loads on the Server.

To use `clientOnly` first isolate the component with DOM interactions in a file.

```tsx twoslash
const location = window.document.location;

export default function ClientOnlyComponent() {
  return <div>{location.href}</div>;
}
```


And then import it dynamically using `clientOnly`.

```tsx twoslash
import { clientOnly } from "@solidjs/start";

const ClientOnlyComp = clientOnly(() => import("../ClientOnlyComp"));

function IsomorphicComp() {
  return <ClientOnlyComp />;
}
```
