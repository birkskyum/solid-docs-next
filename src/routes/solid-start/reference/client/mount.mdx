title: mount
---

`mount` is a method that calls either [`hydrate`](/solid-js/reference/rendering/hydrate) (server rendering) or [`render`](/solid-js/reference/rendering/render) (client rendering) depending on the configuration. 
It is used in [`entry-client.tsx`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/entry-client) to bootstrap an application.

```tsx
import { mount, StartClient } from "@solidjs/start/client";

mount(() => <StartClient />, document.getElementById("app")!);
```

If you set `{ ssr: false }` in the [`defineConfig`](/solid-start/reference/config/define-config), effectively deactivating hydration, then `mount` becomes the same as [`render`](/solid-js/reference/rendering/render).
