title: app.tsx

`app.tsx` defines the document that your application renders.

The `App` component exported from `app.tsx` is the isomorphic (shared on server and browser) entry into your application. This is the point where the code runs on both sides. This is like the classic entry point you would find in Create React App or similar, where you can define your router, and other top level components.

Below is a [basic example](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/solid-start/tree/main/examples/basic?file=src%2Fapp.tsx) where `@solidjs/router` and `@solidjs/meta` are included to setup routing between two pages:


```tsx
import { MetaProvider, Title } from "@solidjs/meta";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";
import { FileRoutes } from "@solidjs/start/router";
import { Suspense } from "solid-js";

export default function App() {
	return (
		<Router
			root={(props) => (
				<MetaProvider>
					<Title>SolidStart - Basic</Title>
					<a href="/">Index</a>
					<a href="/about">About</a>
					<Suspense>{props.children}</Suspense>
				</MetaProvider>
			)}
		>
			<FileRoutes />
		</Router>
	);
}
```

If you don't need a router, SolidStart doesn't force you to have one. Simply return your template of choice instead, like in this [bare example](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/solid-start/tree/main/examples/bare?file=src%2Fapp.tsx):

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```
import { template } from "solid-js/web"
