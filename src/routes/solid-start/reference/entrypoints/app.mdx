title: app.tsx

`app.tsx` defines the document that your application renders.

The `App` component exported from `app.tsx` is the isomorphic (shared on server and browser) entry into your application. This is the point where the code runs on both sides. This is like the classic entry point you would find in Create React App or similar, where you can define your router, and other top level components.

#### Basic Example (with routing)

Here `@solidjs/router` is used to setup navigation between the pages discoved by the `FileRouter`. In order to update the page title on navigation, the `MetaProvider` from `@solidjs/meta` is wrapping the `{props.children}` where the current page will be inserted.


```tsx
import { MetaProvider, Title } from "@solidjs/meta";
import { A, Router } from "@solidjs/router";
import { FileRoutes } from "@solidjs/start/router";
import { Suspense } from "solid-js";

export default function App() {
	return (
		<Router
			root={(props) => (
				<MetaProvider>
					<Title>SolidStart - Basic</Title>
					<A href="/">Index</A>
					<A href="/about">About</A>
					<Suspense>{props.children}</Suspense>
				</MetaProvider>
			)}
		>
			<FileRoutes />
		</Router>
	);
}
```

#### Bare Example (without routing)

If you don't need a router, SolidStart doesn't force you to have one. Simply return your template of choice like this:

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```
