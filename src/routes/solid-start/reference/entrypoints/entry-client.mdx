`entry-client.tsx` is where your app starts in the browser. It does so by passing [`<StartClient>`](/solid-start/reference/client/start-client) and a DOM Element (the mounting point), to the [`mount`](/solid-start/reference/client/mount) function which will bootstrap the app.

```tsx twoslash
import { mount, StartClient } from "@solidjs/start/client";

mount(() => <StartClient />, document.getElementById("app")!);
```

This file is good place to run any other client specific code that you want to happen on startup, such as registering service workers. This is the case both if you're using performing client-only rendering or if you are using our various modes of server-side rendering.
