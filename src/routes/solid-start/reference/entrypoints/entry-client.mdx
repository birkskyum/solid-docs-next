`entry-client.tsx` is where an application starts in the browser. 
It does this by passing [`<StartClient>`](/solid-start/reference/client/start-client) and a DOM Element (the mounting point), to the [`mount`](/solid-start/reference/client/mount) function.

```tsx
import { mount, StartClient } from "@solidjs/start/client";

mount(() => <StartClient />, document.getElementById("app")!);
```

This file is good place to run any other client specific code that you want to happen on startup, such as registering service workers. This is the case both if you're using performing client-only rendering or if you are using our various modes of server-side rendering.
