title: entry-client.tsx

`entry-client.tsx` is where your app starts in the browser.

<div class="text-lg">

```tsx twoslash
import { mount, StartClient } from "@solidjs/start/client";

mount(() => <StartClient />, document.getElementById("app")!);
```

</div>


This file starts the application in the browser. It does so by passing `<StartClient>` and a DOM Element, which is our mounting point, to a `mount` function. `mount` is an alias over Solid's [`hydrate`](/reference/rendering/hydrate) and [`render`](/reference/rendering/render) methods to ensure that the client always starts up properly.

It doesn't matter if you are using SolidStart to do client-only rendering or if you are using our various modes of server-side rendering. This file is good place to run any other client specific code that you want to happen on startup. Things like registering service workers.

## Reference

### `mount(codeFn, mountEl)`

Method that either calls [`hydrate`](/reference/rendering/hydrate) or [`render`](/reference/rendering/render) depending on the configuration.

```tsx twoslash
import { mount, StartClient } from "@solidjs/start/client";

mount(() => <StartClient />, document.getElementById("app")!);
```
