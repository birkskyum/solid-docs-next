title: HttpHeader
---

`HttpHeader` is a component that allows you set a header on the HTTP response sent by the server.

```tsx twoslash
import { HttpHeader } from "@solidjs/start";

<HttpHeader name="x-robots-tag" value="noindex" />;
```

## Setting a header for catch-all routes

```tsx twoslash filename="routes/*404.tsx"
import { HttpHeader, HttpStatusCode } from "@solidjs/start";

export default function NotFound() {
	return (
		<div>
			<HttpStatusCode code={404} />
			<HttpHeader name="my-header" value="header-value" />
		</div>
	);
}
```

As you render the page you may want to add additional HTTP headers to the response. The `HttpHeader` component will do that for you. You can pass it a `name` and `value` and that will get added to the `Response` headers sent back to the browser.

Keep in mind, when streaming responses with [`renderToStream`](/reference/rendering/render-to-stream), HTTP headers can only be included that are added before the stream first flushed. Be sure to add `deferStream` to any resources that needed to be loaded before responding.
