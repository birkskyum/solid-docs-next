Perform actions on the server environment only (i.e. console logging, etc.).

```tsx twoslash
const logHello = async (message: string) => {
	"use server";
	console.log(message);
};
```

## Basic usage

In the two examples below, regardless of whether we are rendering on the server or in the browser, the `logHello` function generates a log on the server console only. To do this we use compilation to transform the `"use server"` function into an RPC call to the server.

If `"use server"` is inserted as the first line in a file, the entire file will become server-only.

```tsx twoslash {1}
"use server";

const logHello = async (message: string) => {
	console.log(message);
};
```

However, if `"use server"` is inserted as the first line of a function, only that function will be server-only:

```tsx twoslash {2}
const logHello = async (message: string) => {
	"use server";
	console.log(message);
};

logHello("Hello");
```

## Serialization

Server functions allow the serialization of many different data types in the response, using the Seroval serializer. The full list is available [here](https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval/blob/main/docs/compatibility.md#supported-types).

## Meta information

To get a stable function-specific identifier, even for parrallel processes or multiple cpu cores or workers, use the [`getServerFunctionMeta`](/solid-start/reference/server/get-server-function-meta)
