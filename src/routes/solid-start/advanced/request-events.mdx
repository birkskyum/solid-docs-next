title: Request Events
---

In SolidStart you get hold of the request event using the [`getRequestEvent`](/reference/server-utilities/get-request-event) from `@solidjs/web` anywhere on the server.

## Locals

SolidStart uses `event.locals` to pass around local context to be used as you see fit.

When adding fields to `event.locals`, you can let Typescript know the types of these fields like so:

```tsx
declare module "@solidjs/start/server" {
	interface RequestEventLocals {
		myNumber: number;
		someString: string;
	}
}
```

## nativeEvent

Sometimes you still need access to the underlying event from Vinxi. You can access that using the `.nativeEvent` property. It is the underlying H3Event used and can be passed to the helpers available in the ecosystem. Keep in mind that Vinxi HTTP helpers do not treeshake so you can only import them in files that do not contain client or isomorphic code.

Many of these events support Async Local Storage so this may not be needed.
